127.0.0.1,"Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid.[1] The game is played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is believed to have originated in India sometime before the 7th century. The game was derived from the Indian game chaturanga, which is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi, janggi, and shogi. Chess reached Europe by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century; the rules were standardized in the 19th century.

Play does not involve hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate[note 1] the opponent's king",Data science is fun and I love working on projects. ,"['die', 5, 1, 'doc2vec', 2, 0.7183305025100708, 1.3921168549931935]","['find', 4, 3, 'doc2vec', 1, 0.7209060192108154, 4.161430089436812]","['array', 5, 3, 'doc2vec', 1, 0.7209060192108154, 4.161430089436812]","['type', 5, 3, 'doc2vec', 1, 0.7209060192108154, 4.161430089436812]","['side', 5, 3, 'doc2vec', 1, 0.7209060192108154, 4.161430089436812]"

Chess reached Europe by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century; the rules were standardized in the 19th century.

Play does not involve hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate[note 1] the opponent's king",Check out these sick puns bro. do you like them?,"['doubt', 1, 1, 'doc2vec', 4, 0.6924110054969788, 1.4442289219280229]","['chess', 0, 2, 'doc2vec', 1, 0.7224089503288269, 2.7685149790705634]","['die', 7, 2, 'doc2vec', 1, 0.7224089503288269, 2.7685149790705634]","['chess', 0, 2, 'doc2vec', 2, 0.7181832790374756, 2.7848044620036854]","['chess', 0, 2, 'doc2vec', 3, 0.7101093530654907, 2.8164676206082127]"

It is an enjoyable distraction, diverting the mind and body from any serious task or contributing an extra dimension to it. Although particularly associated with recreation and play, fun may be encountered during work, social functions, and even seemingly mundane activities of daily living. It may often have little to no logical basis, and opinions on whether an activity is fun may differ. A distinction between enjoyment and fun is difficult but possible to articulate, fun being a more spontaneous, playful, or active event.

Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body

It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as ""the art or science of government"" and ""political principles""), but often does carry a connotation of dishonest malpractice.[1][5][6] The word has been used negatively for many years: the British national anthem as published in 1745 calls on God to ""Confound their politics"",[7] and the phrase ""play politics"", for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: ""We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us","Fuck these people, they never vote for what I care about.
